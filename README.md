# Coursera Web Scraping
This is a Python script to download my certificates into Coursera web pages, using Selenium webdriver.

## Notes

This script requires a cookies file, this file has to contain your profile information from your own cookies.\ 
I'm working on creating the cookies file from a method, but I'll do it later. By now, you must set two variables \
first **MAIL** and **PUBLICKEY**, and set up your **GPG** credential to decrypt the cookies file.
